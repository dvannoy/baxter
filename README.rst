========================

Collection of reusable python modules that are used for data processing at Pluralsight.  This repository contains the modules that have been developed or compiled from other open sources by the Pluralsight data team, but of course it only contains the modules that are generic enough to share with everyone.  For functions that started off based on other examples around the internet a url will be shared within the code comments so that developers can research where the ideas originated.  Tested with Python 2.6 and 2.7 only.
